# NISHIMWE's _**Readr**_

## Description

This is a web application that bridges the gap between readers and their favorite books/authors. It allows readers who owns a copy of a book to share it with other readers who may not have the book but would like to read it, through a digital library. The application also allows readers to share their thoughts on a book by writing a review and rating the book. Readers can also borrow a book from the library and return it when they are done reading it.
